= The Demo Project
Doc Writer <jacobibanez@jacobibanez.com>
:toc:

This folder is a Godot project that you can directly open in Godot to see an implementation of the plugin in a real Godot game.

IMPORTANT: To use this project, you have to uncompress the contents of the `addons.zip` file in the link:https://github.com/Iakobs/godot-play-game-services/releases[releases section] of the repository to the root folder of the project. Alternatively, you can run the `./gradlew assemble` command from the root of the repository. This command will install the plugin in the `addons` directory of the godot project.

== Directory Structure
The demo project contains a `scenes` folder with all the `.tscn` and `.gd` files that you will need, everything is inside this folder.

You have sub folders for every feature of the plugin, e.g. `achievements` for displaying the achievements of the game or `snapshots` for the save/load game functionalities.

== Running the project
IMPORTANT: Make sure that you are using version 4.2+ of Godot. This plugin is only for version 4.2 or higher.

This is an android project with a custom build, so in order to run your game from the Godot editor, you have to install the build template first. Please, refer to the https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/android_gradle_build.html[Godot docs] for further information.

You also have to create an `Export Configuration` for Android. Refer to the https://github.com/Iakobs/godot-play-game-services#export-configuration[README] of the repository.

Finally, you can not run the game as a normal game. Instead, you have to run it in an android device (real or emulated) via the `Remote Debug` button in the top right corner of the Godot editor.

== First time opening the demo project
The first time you open the demo project, you will see this error in the Godot editor:

image::demo_project_error.png[alt="Screenshot of an error in the Godot editor that says:\"Failed to load script \"res://scenes/MainMenu.gd\" with error \"Parse Error\".",title=Error loading script at first run of the project.width=298,aligb=center]

This is completely normal, because the plugin is not yet activated. Simply go to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins` and enable the plugin, which should appear there if you have installed it in the `addons` folder.

After enabling the plugin, confirm that the `GodotPlayGamesServices` autoload appears in the `Autoload` tab. Then simply reload your project from `Project > Reload Current Project`, and you are good to go!

== Initializing the plugin
You have to manually initialize the plugin calling the `GodotPlayGameServices.initialize()` method of the plugin autoload. The Main Menu of the demo game calls it in the `_enter_tree` virtual method.

It uses this method instead of the `_ready` method because this scene also uses the Sign In client, and the plugin needs to be initialized before the clients are loaded into the Scene Tree.

== Signing In
The first thing the project does is checking if the user is authenticated. All methods of the plugin are asynchronous, so you must connect to a signal to receive the answer from the methods.

In this case, the signal received from the `is_authenticated()` method is the `user_authenticated` signal, which is connected to a callback that enables a sign in button in case the user is not authenticated, or enables the rest of the buttons in case the player is authenticated.

The sign in button, in case it's needed, calls the `sign_in()` method of the Sign In Client, which also will emit the same `user_authenticated` signal.

If the user is successfully signed in, you will see the Sign In animation displayed on top of the screen:

image::screenshots/main_menu/main_menu.png[alt=Screenshot of the main menu with the Signed in animation displayed on top,title=Main Menu showing a user logged in.,width=298,align=center]

IMPORTANT: If the user is not signed in, any of the following features *WON'T* work.

== Screens

Now you will find a description of all the screens that you can navigate from the main menu. You can always go back to the main menu with the `Back` button in every sub-screen.

=== Achievements Screen
image::screenshots/achievements/achievements_screen.png[alt=Screenshot of the achievements screen,title=The achievements screen.,width=298,align=center]

In the achievements screen you will see a `Show Achievements` button and a scrollable list of the achievements of the game. Depending on the type of the achievement, you will see another button underneath every achievement to *reveal*, *unlock* or *increment* the achievement.

The `Show Achievements` button opens a new window provided by Google with the list of achievements for the game, but you can only click on them to see a detailed description.

image::screenshots/achievements/show_achievements.png[alt=Screenshot of the screen provided by google, with a list of achievements,title=The achievements screen provided by google.,width=298,align=center]

Closing that window by swiping it down, you will be back at the achievements menu. The loading of the achievements inside the scrollable section, happens in the `Achievements.gd` script.

.Achievements.gd
[source,gdscript,linenums]
----
func _ready() -> void:
	if _achievements_cache.is_empty():
		AchievementsClient.load_achievements(true) # <1>
    # ... more code ...

func _on_achievements_loaded(achievements: Array[PlayGamesAchievement]) -> void: # <2>
	_achievements_cache = achievements
	if not _achievements_cache.is_empty() and achievement_displays.get_child_count() == 0:
		for achievement: PlayGamesAchievement in _achievements_cache: # <3>
			var container := _achievement_display.instantiate() as Control
			container.play_games_achievement = achievement
			container.play_games_achievements_client = play_games_achievements_client
			achievement_displays.add_child(container)
    # ... more code ...
----
<1> If the cache is empty, we call the `load_achievements` method of the plugin.
<2> We subscribe to the `achievemets_loaded` signal to receive the achievements.
<3> For every achievement, we instantiate an `AchievementDisplay.tscn` file and we feed it the achievement and the achievements client. Then, we add the control as a child of the scrollable section.

In the `AchievementDisplay.gd` script, you will find the code with the logic to *reveal*, *unlock* or *increment* a specific achievement, depending on its type and state.

=== Leaderboards Screen
image::screenshots/leaderboards/leaderboards_screen.png[alt=Screenshot of the leaderboards screen,title=The leaderboards screen.,width=298,align=center]

This screen has a `Show Leaderboards` button at the top, and a scrollable list of the leaderboards of the game. Sames as with the achievements screen, the button will open a new screen provided by Google where you can see the leaderboards and interact with them.

Every item in the scrollable list has options to:

* Submit a score to the leaderboard.
* Display a specific variant of that leaderboard, based on it's time span and collection type.

The code that manages all of this behaviour, can be found in the `LeaderboardDisplay.gd` script.

=== Players Screen
image::screenshots/players/current_player.png[alt=Screenshot of the players screen,title=The players screen.,width=298,align=center]

In this screen you can see information about players of Play Game Services.

The `Search Players` button will open a new screen provided by google where you can find other players by their username. If you select them, they will appear in the Players Screen with a button to compare them. This button will open a new window provided by Google where you can compare this player to the signed in player, and also send an invitation to become friends.

The following screenshots show the process:

.Searching and comparing players.

a|image::screenshots/players/send_invite.png[alt=Screenshot of the screen provided by google to compare players,width=298,align=center]
|===

Under the `Search Players` button, you have a section with the current signed in player, and below it, another section with a list of the friends of the current signed in player.

Again, same as with the Achievements screen and the Leaderboards screen, you have a `Players.gd` script that controls the screen, and a `PlayerDisplay.gd` script that manages the logic for every individual player card.

=== Saved Games Screen
image::screenshots/snapshots/save_game.png[alt=Screenshot of the saved games screen,title=The Saved Games screen.,width=298,align=center]

This screen presents a simple menu to load and save games. To save a game, fill the form with a file name, a description and some data to save. When all fields are filled, the `Save Game` button will be enabled and you can save your game.

Pressing the `Load Saved Games` will open a new screen provided by Google with the list of saved games for this game and player.

image::screenshots/snapshots/show_saved_games.png[alt=Screenshot of screen provided by google, with a list of the saved games,title=The Saved Games screen provided by Google.,width=298,align=center]

When you click on `Select`, the contents of the saved game will fill the forms in the previous screen.

The code for this screen is all in the `Snapshots.gd` script.

== Troubleshooting
In order to ease the troubleshooting process, the main menu of the app uses the title at the top to display common error messages.

=== Plugin not found
If the plugin is not found, the title will display this text: #Plugin Not Found!#

=== Signing in
If the user is not signed in, the game automatically tries to sign them in with a retry mechanism.

While trying to sign in, the title will display the #Trying to sign in!# text. After the maximum number of retries (5), if the user wasn't logged in, it will display this text: #Sign in attemps expired!#.

In this case, you should look at the logs of the application. Doing so with Android Studio's logcat is easier. Use this regex to filter the logs: `package:com.jacobibanez.godot.test.game package:com.google.android.gms`
